We, the group organizers and/or event organizers, reserve the right to take any action that we see fit against any person or persons that are found to be in breach of these guidelines including; issuing a warning (verbal or written), asking the offending person or persons to leave the event, or expulsion from the group.</p><h5>Don't be a Jerk</h5><p class="light">GDG/WTM Tangier prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means jerky behavior isn't allowed at GDG meetings. Because we know that it's not obvious to everyone, here's a reminder of things we don't allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, showing port in public, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with someone after they've asked you to stop. Continuous jerky behavior may result in getting expelled from the meeting or GDG Chapter. If someone is bothering you, please tell the GDG Organizers or event host and they will take care of it. We want to maintain GDG tangier's awesomeness.</p><h5>Anti-Harassment Policy</h5><b>Why do we have an official Anti-Harassment policy for GDG Tangier events?</b><ul><ol><p class="light">It sets expectations for behavior at the event. Simply having an anti-harassment policy can prevent harassment.</p></ol><ol><p class="light">It encourages people to attend who have had bad experiences at other events.</p></ol><ol><p class="light">It gives event staff/volunteers instructions on how to handle harassment quickly, with minimum amount of disruption for the event.</p></ol></ul><b>GDG Tangier is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of:</b><p class="light">gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender, identity, age, race, religion, and nationality.</p><p class="light">The above is not an exhaustive list -- we do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks. Event participants violating these rules may be expelled from the event, and event banned from future events at the discretion of the event organizers/management.</p><p class="light">If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer or event volunteer immediately. Organizers and event volunteers may be identified by t-shirts or special badges/lanyards. Organizers will investigate the issue and take appropriate action. This may include helping participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist these experiencing harassment to fell safe for the duration of the event.</p><p class="light">Though we hope that we never have to invoke this policy, we believe that having this document helps everyone think a little more about how their actions and words affect the whole community, as well as individuals in the community.</p><h5>Values</h5><p class="light">GDG Tangier is an inclusive community where developers, designers, and entrepreneurs of all skill levels, genders, religions, and backgrounds are welcome to learn, practice, and share Google technologies, services, and platforms. Our motto is “Meet, Learn, Share” if you see or experience anything different please contact <a href="https://www.meetup.com/gdgtangier/members">OUR ORGANIZERS</a>.</p></div><footer class="page-footer black"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col l6 s12"><h5 class="white-text">GDG/WTM Tangier</h5><p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">Our main mission at Tangier is to help developers become better developers.
